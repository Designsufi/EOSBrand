#### Chestahedron

The Chestahedron, named after artist Frank Chester, is constructed with equilateral triangles around the base, and the geometry adjusted so the kite faces have the same area as the equilateral triangles.The last can be seen by augmenting a regular tetrahedron and an octahedron, leaving 10 equilateral triangle faces, and then merging 3 sets of coparallel equilateral triangular faces into 3 (60 degree) rhombic faces. It can also be seen as a tetrahedron with 3 of 4 of its vertices rectified. The three rhombic faces fold out flat to form half of a hexagram.

The Chestahedron is a 3d symbol and thus depicted in many different ways.
The most common way is to show a 2dimentional description of the element.

#### Logo Usage

The SVG contains two version, one version with light chestahedron for dark backgrounds,
and another version with dark logo suitable for light backgrounds. 

The fat version works better as small logo or for visual animation.

Depicting the Chestahedron in the 2d plane can be done in various ways. 
Other descriptions in SVG might be a way to further explore different roles in the community
when we start making an iconography and assets library.

Bootstrapping on top of material design might be a good starting point.
Add Icons as they emerge.


#### Animated SVG
Used to show motion or rotation. Please be wary of constantly rotating the logo. This can become nuisance and iritating if left spinning for a long period of time. Once we release the animated svg we can animate the motion based on code and interaction instead of the GIF loop
made popular by Block One during the ICO phase.


#### Black & White

A separate SVG contains a solid black version suitable for certain design or print applications. A variation with red liquid is provided as a separate layer.

## PNG Images

Iâ€™ve also included images which can be used directly without having to muck about
with exporting them from the SVG every time. There are two PNGs for each version (dark/light),
one image with a solid background, and one with a transparent background.
